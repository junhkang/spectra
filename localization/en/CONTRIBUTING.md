# Contributing to Spectra

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Spectra. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [junhkang91@gmail.com].

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Spectra. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/junhkang/spectra/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on the repository and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps** which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the project, e.g., which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started the project in your browser.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that the project crashed, include a stack trace of the crash.**
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a [profiling capture](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) with your report.**
* **Add a list of all software versions** that you're using. For example, the Node.js or Python version you're using, the operating system version, and the browser version.
* **Mention the commit SHA** from the project where the problem occurs.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Spectra's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Spectra
- Enable a sustainable system for Spectra's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow the project coding style.
2. Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
3. Make commits of logical units.
4. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
5. Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
6. Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
7. Run all the tests to ensure nothing else was broken.

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
